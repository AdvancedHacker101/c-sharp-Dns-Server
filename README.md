# C# Dns Server
Visual Studio 2017, .NET Framework 4.5.2, c# console application
This dns server mirrors google's dns server (8.8.8.8).
It can work in normal mode, and in MITM Mode.
MITM mode contaisns dropping and/or redirecting request/response.
The program has a class wich can serialize a DNS request/response, deseralize a DNS request/response.
So you have full control above the dns request sent and the response received.

Use it on other people's computer only with their permission, otherwise use it on your own computer/VM.
