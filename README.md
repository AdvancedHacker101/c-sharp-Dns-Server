# C\# Dns Server
C\# Console application, that mirrors google's dns server (8.8.8.8) and can modify traffic (MITM mode)  
Two MITM functions are available:
- Dropping Response
- Redirecting Response (replying with a fake ip address to the request) A.K.A Dns Spoofing  

The program has a class which can serialize a DNS request/response, deseralize a DNS request/response.  
So you have full control above the dns request sent and the response received.
